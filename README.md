# FMRI_Classification
this project is a part of a final project at FMRI machine learning course in HIT- by dr' Erez Simoni and Eyal Hizmi.
# Project details
This project describes an experiment about classification of FMRI signals.
In this experimentgroup A with 35 students watched 20 minutes of Sherlock series of BBC. 
group B other 35 students answer quastions about 49 events in the movie.
