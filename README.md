# FMRI_Classification
This project is a part of a final project at FMRI machine learning course in HIT- by dr' Erez Simoni and Eyal Hizmi.
# Project details
This project describes an experiment about classification of FMRI signals.
In this experimentgroup A with 35 students watched 20 minutes of Sherlock series of BBC. 

group B other 35 students answer quastions about 49 events in the movie.
using the answers of group B we got the classifications for the behavier for thos events.

results of  machin learninfg
this project makes machine learning on Fmri data set, on people
Who listened and saw movie.
It makes classification on their brain activity And between 7 emotions during the movie.
